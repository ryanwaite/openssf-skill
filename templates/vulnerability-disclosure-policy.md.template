# Vulnerability Disclosure Policy

## Introduction

[Organization/Project Name] is committed to the security of our users and systems. We welcome and appreciate security researchers who help us identify vulnerabilities in our projects.

This policy describes how to report vulnerabilities to us and what you can expect from us in return.

## Scope

### In Scope

The following are in scope for this vulnerability disclosure policy:

- Source code in this repository
- Official releases and packages
- Official documentation sites
- APIs and services directly operated by this project

### Out of Scope

The following are NOT in scope:

- Third-party dependencies (report to their maintainers)
- Unofficial forks or mirrors
- Physical security or social engineering
- Denial of service attacks
- Issues requiring physical access to a user's device

## Safe Harbor

We support safe harbor for security researchers who:

- Act in good faith
- Avoid privacy violations, data destruction, and service disruption
- Report vulnerabilities through our designated channels
- Give us reasonable time to address issues before disclosure

We will not pursue legal action against researchers who follow this policy.

## Reporting Process

### Step 1: Discover

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please gather:
- A description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact
- Any proof-of-concept code (if safe to share)

### Step 2: Report

Submit your report through one of these channels:

**Preferred: GitHub Security Advisories**
- Navigate to the Security tab
- Click "Report a vulnerability"
- Complete the advisory form

**Alternative: Email**
- Send to: [security@example.com]
- Use PGP encryption if available: [link]
- Subject: [SECURITY] Brief description

### Step 3: Wait for Response

We will:
- Acknowledge receipt within 48 hours
- Provide an initial assessment within 7 days
- Keep you informed of progress

### Step 4: Coordinate

We may ask for:
- Additional information
- Verification of the fix
- Agreement on disclosure timeline

### Step 5: Resolution

Once resolved:
- We will release a fix
- We will publish a security advisory
- We will credit you (unless you prefer anonymity)

## Response Timeline

| Severity | Target Resolution |
|----------|-------------------|
| Critical | 7 days |
| High | 30 days |
| Medium | 60 days |
| Low | 90 days |

*Timelines may vary based on complexity and coordination requirements.*

## Severity Classification

We use the following severity levels:

**Critical**
- Remote code execution
- Authentication bypass
- Data breach potential
- Supply chain compromise

**High**
- Privilege escalation
- Significant data exposure
- Cross-site scripting with impact
- SQL injection

**Medium**
- Limited data exposure
- Denial of service
- CSRF with limited impact

**Low**
- Information disclosure (minor)
- Best practice violations
- Non-default configurations

## Recognition

We believe in recognizing the contributions of security researchers:

- **Hall of Fame**: Researchers will be listed in our security acknowledgments
- **CVE Credit**: Researchers will be credited in any CVE published
- **Reference Letters**: Available upon request for valid reports

## Legal

This policy does not authorize any activity that would violate applicable laws. By participating in our vulnerability disclosure program, you agree to:

- Comply with all applicable laws
- Not access data beyond what is necessary
- Not modify or delete data
- Not disrupt services
